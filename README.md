# Christoffs Menu App

I created this menu app to help Chef Christoff with his prestige resturant dealing. It will help him prepare and show what is on the menu for the day. As well as add new items and delete items that are no longer available. It is a 3 page app. A Homescreeen, that shows the menu items that is up to order for the day with the desription and pricing. The menu items i coded to automate the menu items for the day with the pricing. You can also delete with the bin icon. The second screen is the Add menu screen. You go to the screen by clicking on the "+" icon and it will take you to the page. This is where you can add your own personal Menu items, Despritions, select if it is a "Main, starter, dessert or drinks" and finally the pricing. The 3rd is a settings screen. Basically what the app is doing, i added it for jokes.
